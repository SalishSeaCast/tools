  This is a temporary, initial page that publishes information from the
  <a href="http://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/nemo.html">Salish Sea NEMO model</a> nowcast effort.

<h1>Log Files</h1>
  <p>
    The log files contain messages from the nowcast automation workers and manager processes.
    Each day's run is in a separate log file.
    When the worker-automated part of the run is completed the log file is rolled over,
    as are the previous log files.
    The log for the current day's run (nowcast.log) is rolled over to nowcast.log.1,
    and the previous nowcast.log.1 is rolled over to nowcast.log.2,
    etc.
    A total of 7 day's log files are retained.
  </p>
  <p>
    At present all of the pre-processing steps are included in the worker automation,
    as is the run results downloading step.
    So,
    there is a pause in the log while the run is manually queued on orcinus and while it is executed,
    but the log resumes with downloading of the results,
    after which  the log file rollovers happen.
