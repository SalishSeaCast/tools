The IPython Notebooks in this directory document
the development stage of the figure plotting functions in the
`salishsea_tools.nowcast.figures` module.

The
[DevelopingNowcastFigureFunctions.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/SalishSeaTools/salishsea_tools/nowcast/DevelopingNowcastFigureFunctions.ipynb)
notebook describes the recommended process for development of those functions,
and provides an example of development of one.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

    This notebook describes the recommended process for development of
    functions for the `salishsea_tools.nowcast.figures` module,
    and provides an example of development of such a function.

* ##[DailyNowcastFigures.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/SalishSeaTools/salishsea_tools/nowcast/DailyNowcastFigures.ipynb)
    Template notebook for creation of notebooks that show daily figures
    from most recent Salish Sea NEMO model real-time (nowcast) run.

    This is an interim step toward fully automated web publication of
    analysis and monitoring figures from nowcast runs.
