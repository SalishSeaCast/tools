.. _SalishSeaToolsPackageDevelopment:

********************************************
:py:obj:`SalishSeaTools` Package Development
********************************************

.. _SalishSeaToolsPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/python/required-version-toml?tomlFilePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd/main/pyproject.toml&logo=Python&logoColor=gold&label=Python
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3
    :alt: Python Version from PEP 621 TOML

The :py:obj:`SalishSeaTools` package is developed using `Python`_ 3.13.
The minimum supported Python version is 3.11.
The :ref:`SalishSeaToolsContinuousIntegration` workflow on GitHub ensures that the package
is tested for all versions of Python>=3.11.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/


.. _SalishSeaToolsGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/tools

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:SalishSeaCast/tools.git


.. _SalishSeaToolsDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`salishsea-tools` that will have
all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands:

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd tools
    $ conda env create -f SalishSeaTools/envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate salishsea-tools

:kbd:`SalishSeaTools` is installed in `editable install mode`_ as part of the conda environment
creation process.
That means that the package is installed from the cloned repo in a way that it will be
automatically updated as the repo evolves.

.. _editable install mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-tools)$ conda deactivate


.. _SalishSeaToolsBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

The documentation for the :kbd:`SalishSeaTools` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.
Creating a :ref:`SalishSeaToolsDevelopmentEnvironment` as described above includes the installation of Sphinx.
The documentation is integrated into the :ref:`tools-repo` docs.
Building the documentation is driven by :file:`tools/docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`salishsea-tools` development environment activated,
use:

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-tools)$ cd tools
    (salishsea-tools)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like::

  rm -rf _build/*
  sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html
  Running Sphinx v1.3.1
  making output directory...

  writing additional pages... search

  copying extra files... done
  dumping search index in English (code: en) ... done
  dumping object inventory... done
  build succeeded.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`tools/docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`SalishSeaTools/index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build before committing and pushing your changes to Bitbucket.

Whenever you push changes to the :ref:`tools-repo` on Bitbucket the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://salishsea-meopar-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/SalishSeaTools/.


.. _SalishSeaToolsRuningTheUnitTests:

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :kbd:`SalishSeaTools` package is in :file:`tools/SalishSeaTools/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tools is used for test fixtures and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`salishsea-tools` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-tools)$ cd tools/SalishSeaTools/
    (salishsea-tools)$ pytest

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like::

  ============================ test session starts =============================
  platform linux -- Python 3.5.1, pytest-2.8.5, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1

You can monitor what lines of code the test suite exercises using the `coverage.py`_ and `pytest-cov`_ tools with the command:

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _pytest-cov: https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-tools)$ cd tools/SalishSeaTools/
    (salishsea-tools)$ pytest --cov=./

The test coverage report will be displayed below the test suite run output.

Alternatively,
you can use

.. code-block:: bash

    (salishsea-tools)$ pytest --cov=./ --cov-report html

to produce an HTML report that you can view in your browser by opening
:file:`tools/SalishSeaTools/htmlcov/index.html`.


.. _SalishSeaToolsContinuousIntegration:

Continuous Integration
----------------------

The :kbd:`SalishSeaTools` package unit test suite is run and a coverage report is generated
whenever changes are pushed to GitHub.
The results are visible on the `repo actions page`_,
from the green checkmarks beside commits on the `repo commits page`_,
or from the green checkmark to the left of the "Latest commit" message on the
`repo code overview page`_ .
The testing coverage report is uploaded to `codecov.io`_

.. _repo actions page: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaTools/actions
.. _repo commits page: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaTools/commits/main
.. _repo code overview page: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaTools
.. _codecov.io: https://app.codecov.io/gh/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaTools

The `GitHub Actions`_ workflow configuration that defines the continuous integration
tasks is in the :file:`.github/workflows/pytest-with-coverage.yaml` file.

.. _GitHub Actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions


.. _SalishSeaToolsVersionControlRepository:

Version Control Repository
==========================

The :kbd:`SalishSeaTools` package code and documentation source files are available as part of the :ref:`tools-repo` `Git`_ repository at https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/tools.

.. _Git: https://git-scm.com/


.. _SalishSeaToolsIssueTracker:

Issue Tracker
=============

Development tasks,
bug reports,
and enhancement ideas are recorded and managed in the issue tracker at https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/tools/issues using the component tag :kbd:`SalishSeaTools`.


Release Process
===============

Releases are done at Doug's discretion when significant pieces of development work have been
completed.

The release process steps are:

#. Use :command:`hatch version release` to bump the version from ``.devn`` to the next release
   version identifier

#. Confirm that :file:`tools/docs/breaking_changes.rst` includes any relevant notes for the
   version being released

#. Commit the version bump and breaking changes log update


#. Create an annotated tag for the release with :guilabel:`Git -> New Tag...` in PyCharm
   or :command:`git tag -e -a vyy.n`

#. Push the version bump commit and tag to GitHub

#. Use the GitHub web interface to create a release,
   editing the auto-generated release notes into sections:

   * Features
   * Bug Fixes
   * Documentation
   * Maintenance
   * Dependency Updates

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to edit the release
   milestone:

   * Change the :guilabel:`Due date` to the release date
   * Delete the "when it's ready" comment in the :guilabel:`Description`

#. Use the GitHub :guilabel:`Issues -> Milestones` web interface to create a milestone for
   the next release:

   * Set the :guilabel:`Title` to the next release version,
     prepended with a ``v``;
     e.g. ``v25.1``
   * Set the :guilabel:`Due date` to the end of the year of the next release
   * Set the :guilabel:`Description` to something like
     ``v25.1 release - when it's ready :-)``
   * Create the next release milestone

#. Review the open issues,
   especially any that are associated with the milestone for the just released version,
   and update their milestone.

#. Close the milestone for the just released version.

#. Use :command:`hatch version minor,dev` to bump the version for the next development cycle,
   or use :command:`hatch version major,minor,dev` for a year rollover version bump

#. Commit the version bump

#. Push the version bump commit to GitHub
