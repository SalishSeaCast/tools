The IPython Notebooks in this directory are evaluation of the
tide and storm surge results calculated by the Salish Sea NEMO model.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[comp_wlev_harm-wNorth.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/comp_wlev_harm-wNorth.ipynb)  
    
* ##[comp_wlev_harm_compositerun.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/comp_wlev_harm_compositerun.ipynb)  
    
* ##[comp_current_harm.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/comp_current_harm.ipynb)  
    
    Compare harmonics from currents between measured and modelled. Measured harmonics are taken from Table 3 of Foreman et al (1995)  


* ##[find_wlev_stations.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/find_wlev_stations.ipynb)  
    
    Where shall we evaluate the storm surge performance of the model? The station needs to have water level data for the period of 2002-2010 (this is when we have wind data).  
      
    * Point Atkinson (49.34,-123.25)  
      
    * Victoria Harbour (48.42,-123.37)  
      
    * Patricia Bay (48.65,-123.45)  
      
    * Campbell River (50.04,-125.25)  
      
    All other sites are not in our domain or do not have water level data for these points  

* ##[comp_wlev_ts.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/comp_wlev_ts.ipynb)  
    
* ##[find_storms.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/find_storms.ipynb)  
    
* ##[plot_foreman_thalweg.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/plot_foreman_thalweg.ipynb)  
    
    Plot the Foreman et al (1995) model results against our model results, along a thalweg (the thalweg is defined and plotted by Nancy in computer_thalweg.ipynb)  

* ##[Single Tide 2 days.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/Single Tide 2 days.ipynb)  
    
* ##[comp_wlev_harm.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/comp_wlev_harm.ipynb)  
    
* ##[plot_foreman_thalweg-withNorth.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/plot_foreman_thalweg-withNorth.ipynb)  
    
    For results including the Northern Boundary,  
    plot the Foreman et al (1995) model results against our model results, along a thalweg (the thalweg is defined and plotted by Nancy in computer_thalweg.ipynb)  

* ##[plot_current_ellipses.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/compare_tides/plot_current_ellipses.ipynb)
