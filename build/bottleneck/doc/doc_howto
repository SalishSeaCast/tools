Upload Sphinx docs to web server
================================

Godaddy doesn't allow rsyc. So to upload Sphinx docs to
http://berkeleyanalytics.com/bottleneck:

In bottleneck/doc:

$ make clean
$ make html

Then to upload (it will ask for the password):

$ scp -r build/html/* username@berkeleyanalytics.com:html/bottleneck/
