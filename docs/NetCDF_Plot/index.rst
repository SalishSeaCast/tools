NetCDF_Plot Tools
*****************

The :file:`tools/NetCDF_Plot/` directory contains:

* :file:`GYRE_openNC_plot.ipynb`: an IPython Notebook that opens NetCDF files from a test run of NEMO 3.4 in the GYRE configuration.
  It then prepares a contour plot of temperature and a quiver plot of velocity.

* :file:`WCSD_openNC_plot.ipynb`: an IPython Notebook that opens NetCDF files from a tarball version of tidal model run of NEMO 3.1 that J-P sent.
  It then prepares a contour plot of north-south velocity and a flickery movie of sea surface height.
