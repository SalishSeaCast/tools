The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[compareViscosity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Nancy/compareViscosity.ipynb)  
    
    A script to compare runs with different viscosities.  

* ##[crashAnalysis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Nancy/crashAnalysis.ipynb)  
    
    A code to look at the data from the crashed run. What is going wrong!  
    Looks at currents, bathymetry, and sea surface height around the crashed time step.   

* ##[nu200_nu50.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Nancy/nu200_nu50.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook runs a comparison between the $\nu=200$ and $\nu=50$ simulations by Doug.   
      
    The focus is on currents and tracers.   

* ##[northAnalysis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Nancy/northAnalysis.ipynb)  
    
    An analysis of the open boundary conditions at the north.   

* ##[mergeCompare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Nancy/mergeCompare.ipynb)  
    
    Comparing merge-tests on Salish and Japser. A week long run to see how the differences evolve.
