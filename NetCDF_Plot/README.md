The IPython Notebooks in this directory are initial experiments
around visualization of NEMO results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[compareViscosity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/compareViscosity.ipynb)  
    
    A script to compare runs with different viscosities.  

* ##[compute_thalweg.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/compute_thalweg.ipynb)  
    
* ##[crashAnalysis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/crashAnalysis.ipynb)  
    
    A code to look at the data from the crashed run. What is going wrong!  
    Looks at currents, bathymetry, and sea surface height around the crashed time step.   

* ##[GYRE_openNC_plot.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/GYRE_openNC_plot.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook opens NetCDF files from a test run of NEMO 3.4 in the GYRE configuration.  It then prepares a contour plot of temperature and a quiver plot of velocity.  

* ##[mergeCompare-noBC.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/mergeCompare-noBC.ipynb)  
    
    Similar to the mergeCompare notbeook but looking but removing the baroclinic boundary conditions.  

* ##[mergeCompare-orginal.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/mergeCompare-orginal.ipynb)  
    
    Comparing merge-tests on Salish and Japser. This one examines the original test case. Similar results occur for the more recent merges.   

* ##[mergeCompare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/mergeCompare.ipynb)  
    
* ##[NancysCurrents.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/NancysCurrents.ipynb)  
    
    A script to examine currents. It includes a function for unstaggering the u/v data.  

* ##[nu200_nu50.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/nu200_nu50.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook runs a comparison between the $\nu=200$ and $\nu=50$ simulations by Doug.   
      
    The focus is on currents and tracers.   

* ##[SusansViewerWQuiver.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/SusansViewerWQuiver.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Tidal Movie.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Tidal Movie.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook that opens the NetCDF files created by NEMO and creates a movie.  


* ##[Vertical Tracer Cross-sections.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Vertical Tracer Cross-sections.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to plot surface salinity and vertical cross-sections  

* ##[WCSD_openNC_plot.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/WCSD_openNC_plot.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook that opens the NetCDF(3) files created by BIO CONCEPTS 110 WCSD and plots them.  
    Velocity plots are totally dominated by high velocities in the islands. Most useful is the flickery movie of the seasurface height.
