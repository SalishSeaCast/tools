The IPython Notebooks in this directory provide discussion,
examples, and best practices for plotting various kinds of model results
from netCDF files. There are code examples in the notebooks and also
examples of the use of functions from the
[`salishsea_tools`](http://salishsea-meopar-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/SalishSeaTools/salishsea-tools.html)
package.
If you are new to the Salish Sea MEOPAR project or to IPython Notebook,
netCDF, and Matplotlib you should read the introductory notebooks
in the following order:

* [Exploring netCDF Files.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Exploring netCDF Files.ipynb)
* [Plotting Bathymetry Colour Meshes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Plotting Bathymetry Colour Meshes.ipynb)
* [Plotting Tracers on Surface and Depth Slices.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/tools/raw/tip/NetCDF_Plot/Plotting Tracers on Surface and Depth Slices.ipynb)

Also included are notebooks from initial experiments around visualization
of NEMO results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
